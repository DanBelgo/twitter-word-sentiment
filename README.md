# Twitter Word Sentiment Analysis
> What's the opinion of Twitter on a keyword?

## General info

The idea of this script is simple: you type a word, and it extracts the overall sentiment surrounding that word.

Tweets are classified as "positive", "negative", or "neutral", depending on what sentiment is more present (neutral tweets have the same amount of positiveness and negativeness).

You can find the some [examples](#Examples) at the end of this file

## Setup
I used

· R (4.0.3 ver)
· A Twitter Developer Account

More recent R versions can be used.

**IMPORTANT:** You have to create an app in your Twitter Developer Account, get the key, secret, access token and access secret. Otherwise, it won't work.

## Features

* Twitter Scrapper: The R script is ready
* Sentiment Analysis: The R Script cleans the tweets and runs the sentiment analyzer
* Graphic Output: The script will produce a waffle chart with the results.
